   Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup boasting near full equivalence to Ethereum. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Optimism team. Fraud proofs have yet to be enabled on the platform. The way the protocol is structured and maintained makes it easy  for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 5F | PUSH0 |  | Not supported yet! <br /><br /> Solidity version `0.8.20` or higher can only be used with an evm version lower than the default `shanghai`. <br /><br /> Versions up to `0.8.19` (included) are fully compatible | Places value 0 on the stack <Unsupported /> |
    | 41 | COINBASE | `block.coinbase` | Undefined | Get the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Unsupported /> |
    | 32 | ORIGIN | `tx.origin` | The opcodes has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case `tx.origin` is set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get the execution origination address <Modified /> |
    | 33 | CALLER | `msg.sender` | The opcode has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case, the top-level contract to be called on L2 has `msg.sender` set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get caller address <Modified /> |
    | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | L2 block number | Gets the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | 44 | DIFFICULTY | `block.difficulty` | Random value. <br /><br /> As this value is set by the sequencer, it is less reliably random than the L1 equivalent. <br /><br /> [You can use an oracle for randomness](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/oracles/#verifiable-randomness-function-vrf). | Get the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Optimism charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://sdk.optimism.io/modules.html#asL2Provider)
    for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas
    costs information.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Optimism in regards to L1 ←→ L2 messaging and computing L2 transaction fees.
