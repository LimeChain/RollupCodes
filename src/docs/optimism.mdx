title: Optimism
subtitle: Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup which has close to 1:1 parity with Ethereum. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer and has no fraud proofs enabled yet. The protocol has a good abstraction over the different parts of the stack, which makes it suitable for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.
