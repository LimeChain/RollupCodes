   Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup boasting near full equivalence to Ethereum. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Optimism team. Fraud proofs have yet to be enabled on the platform. The way the protocol is structured and maintained makes it easy  for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | | Opcode | Name | Solidity equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 41 | COINBASE | `block.coinbase` | Undefined | Get the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Unsupported /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 32 | ORIGIN | `tx.origin` | The opcodes has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case `tx.origin` is set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get the execution origination address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 33 | CALLER | `msg.sender` | The opcode has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case, the top-level contract to be called on L2 has `msg.sender` set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get caller address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |

    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 44 | DIFFICULTY | `block.difficulty` | Random value. <br /><br /> As this value is set by the sequencer, it is less reliably random than the L1 equivalent. <br /><br /> [You can use an oracle for randomness](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/oracles/#verifiable-randomness-function-vrf). | Get the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    |      | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `optimism_outputAtBlock` | Integer block number or string one of `safe`, `latest` or `pending` | Returns the requested `l2OutputRoot` containing `version` and `l2OutputRoot` | N/A <Added /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `optimism_syncStatus` | None | Returns information on node’s current, head, safe and finalised L1 state, as well as unsafe, safe and finalized L2 state | N/A <Added /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Optimism charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://sdk.optimism.io/modules.html#asL2Provider)
    for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas
    costs information.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Optimism in regards to L1 ←→ L2 messaging and computing L2 transaction fees.
