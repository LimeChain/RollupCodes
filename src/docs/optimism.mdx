subtitle: Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup which has close to 1:1 parity with Ethereum. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer and has no fraud proofs enabled yet. The protocol has a good abstraction over the different parts of the stack, which makes it suitable for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

<Section title="Overview">
    Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup which has close to 1:1 parity with Ethereum. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer and has no fraud proofs enabled yet. The protocol has a good abstraction over the different parts of the stack, which makes it suitable for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | | Opcode | Name | Solidity equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 41 | `COINBASE` | `block.coinbase` | Undefined | Get the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Unsupported /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 32 | `ORIGIN` | `tx.origin` | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, then `tx.origin` is set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the L1 ⇒ L2 transaction. Otherwise, this opcode behaves normally. | Get the execution origination address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 33 | `CALLER` | `msg.sender` | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, and this is the initial call (rather than an internal transaction from one contract to another), the same address aliasing behaviour applies. | Get caller address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 42 | `TIMESTAMP` | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 43 | `NUMBER` | `block.number` | L2 block number | Gets the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 44 | `DIFFICULTY` | `block.difficulty` | Random value. As this value is set by the sequencer, it is less reliably random than the L1 equivalent. [You can use an oracle for randomness](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/oracles/#verifiable-randomness-function-vrf). | Get the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `optimism_outputAtBlock` | `blockNumber` - 64 bits L2 integer block number or `string` - one of `safe`, `latest` or `pending` | Returns the requested `l2OutputRoot` containing `version` and `l2OutputRoot` | N/A <Added /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Optimism charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://sdk.optimism.io/modules.html#asL2Provider)
    for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas
    costs information.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    @eth-optimism/sdk is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Optimism in regards to L1 ←→ L2 messaging and computing L2 transaction fees.
