<Section title="Overview">
   Base is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing OP Stack technology. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Base team.

    ###### Focus

    - Contribute to the Research and Development of the Optimism SuperChain, the goal of which is to enable superior interoperability and aligned crypto-economic incentives for a shared sequencer set between all OP-based rollups.
    - Progressively decentralize the upgradeability of the Base and Optimism Mainnet smart contracts.

    | 32 | ORIGIN | `tx.origin` | The opcodes has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case `tx.origin` is set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get the execution origination address <Modified /> |
    | 33 | CALLER | `msg.sender` | The opcode has the same behaviour as in Ethereum L1 except for situations in which the transaction is an L1 to L2 transaction. <br /><br /> In that case, the top-level contract to be called on L2 has `msg.sender` set to the [aliased address](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the transaction. | Get caller address <Modified /> |
    | 44 | PREVRANDAO | `block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` | Returns the randomness beacon provided by the L1 beacon chain of the latest synced L1 state on the L2 | Get the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` | None | Not supported  | Creates a filter in the node to notify when new pending transactions arrive. <Unsupported /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Base charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://sdk.optimism.io/modules.html#asL2Provider)
    for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas
    costs information.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, viem, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [viem/op-stack](https://viem.sh/op-stack) provides first-class support for chains implemented on the OP Stack.
