<Section title="Overview">
    Scroll is a ZK-Rollup that targets bytecode-level compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the protocol team. The zkEVM circuits are based on Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Group research work on zkEVMs.
    
    ###### Focus

    - Progressively decentralize the sequencer and prover of the network.

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The Scroll JSON RPC API behaves the same way as the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `scroll_getBlockTraceByNumberOrHash`| Block number of Hash | Returns execution trace for the block. | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getL1MessageByIndex` | Integer | Queries an L1 message by its index in the local database. | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getFirstQueueIndexNotInL2Block` | Block hash | Returns the first L1 message queue index that is not included in the chain up to and including the provided block | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getBlockByHash` | Hash, Flag `fullTx` (boolean) | Returns information about L2 block | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getBlockByNumber` | Integer, Flag `fullTx` (boolean) | Returns  information about L2 block. | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getSkippedTransaction` | Transaction hash | Returns transaction not included in verification by hash | N/A <Added /> |
    | `scroll_getSkippedTransactionHashes` | From block, To block | Returns a list of transactions not included in verification | N/A <Added /> |
    
</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Transaction fees are paid in Ether. Developers must set gasPrice high enough so that the sequencer would include the transaction in a batch. Information on the gas price can be retrieved from the JSON RPC endpoint.
    The L1 calldata fee (aka L1 data fee) is deducted directly from the sender’s balance before a transaction’s execution, not paid for using gas. If you need to, you can use the predeployed [L1GasOracle](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000002) to get an estimate of the L1 fee that will be applied for a given transaction.

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
