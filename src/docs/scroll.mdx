<Section title="Overview">
    Scroll is a ZK-Rollup aiming for bytecode-equivalent zkEVM circuit. The protocol features an open source sequencer and prover, however only whitelisted sequencers and provers can participate.
    
    ###### Focus

    - Decentralizing the sequencer and prover components of the protocol.

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 40 | BLOCKHASH | `block.blockhash` | Returns keccak(chain_id || block_number) for the last 256 blocks. | Get the L1 block hash fro block number <Modified /> |

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_getBalance` | Address and integer block number (or the string `latest`, `earliest` or `pending`) | Returns the balance of the account of the given address.<br /><br />The `earliest` parameter will not work as expected currently, because genesis block balances are not currently imported | Returns the balance of the account of the given address. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getLogs` | Address, From block, To block, topics, pagination options | Returns an array of logs matching filter with given id<br /><br />Will never return more than 1000 log entries. For this reason, you can use pagination options to request the next page. Pagination options params: logIndex, blockNumber, transactionIndex | Returns an array of all logs matching filter with given id. <Modified /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Scroll charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use the predeployed [L1GasOracle](https://blockscout.scroll.io/address/0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000002) to get an estimate of the current L1 fee.

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
