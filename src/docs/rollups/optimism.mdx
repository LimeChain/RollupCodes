name: Optimism
summary: Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup which has close to 1:1 parity with Ethereum. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer and has no fraud proofs enabled yet. The protocol has a good abstraction over the different parts of the stack, which makes it suitable for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

#### Overview

Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup which has close to 1:1 parity with Ethereum. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer and has no fraud proofs enabled yet. The protocol has a good abstraction over the different parts of the stack, which makes it suitable for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.

#### Incompatibilities

##### OPCODEs

The following EVM OPCODES behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation

##### Precompiles

No changes have been made to the native precompiles supported by Ethereum L1

##### Transaction Fees

Optimism charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use @eth-optimism/sdk for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas costs information.

#### Additional Features

##### System Precompiles
