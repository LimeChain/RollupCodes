<Section title="Overview">

    > ⚠️ The rollup is still in development. Information presented here may change by the time Mainnet is launched.

    Taiko aims to be a Type 1 EVM compatible ZK-Rollup. The current design uses decentralised and permissionless sequencers and provers. The zkEVM circuits are based on the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Group research work on zkEVMs, where the team is active contributor.
   
    ###### Focus

    - Implementing circuits for verifying all OPCODEs and Precompiles. The execution of some components of the EVM is currently not verified by the circuits.
    - Finalising development and launching Taiko Mainnet.

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 41 | COINBASE | | Returns the address of the L2 block proposer | Gets the block’s beneficiary address <Modified />  |
    | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | L2 block number | Gets the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | 48 | BASEFEE | `block.basefee` | Returns the L2 base fee | Returns the base fee <Modified />  |

    All other OPCODEs defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however, the execution of some OPCODEs is not verified by the circuits and its not part of the validity proofs.

</Section>

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    > ⚠️ All Precompiled Contacts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however, the execution of those Precompiles is currently not covered by the circuits and therefore not present in the Validity proof

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | <Copy value="0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f" label="0x95f..6f" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL1" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L1/TaikoL1.sol" /> | Used for proposing, proving and verifying L2 blocks on L1. |
    | <Copy value="0x1000777700000000000000000000000000000001" label="0x10007777..01" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL2" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L2/TaikoL2.sol" /> | Used to create anchor transaction tracking latest synced L1 block hash and block height. |

</Section>

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `taiko_headL1Origin` | None | Returns the latest L2 block's corresponding L1 origin | N/A <Added /> |
    | `taiko_l1OriginByID` | L2 block number | Returns the L2 block's corresponding L1 origin | N/A <Added /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Transaction fees are paid in Ether. There is no concept of an L1 calldata fee commonly used in other rollups. Developers must set gasPrice high enough so that the proposer would include their transaction in the proposed block. The base fee is set to a constant '1' wei. 

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
