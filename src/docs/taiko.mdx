title: Taiko
subtitle: Taiko aims to be a Based and Type1 equivalent Rollup. It uses tiered multi-proofs system. Currently the protocol uses SGX proofs (lowest tier proofs) which makes it an Optimistic Rollup. The zkEVM circuits are higher tier proofs not yet enabled in production.

<Section title="Overview">

   Taiko is a Based Contestable Rollup that aims to be a Type 1 (Ethereum-equivalent) ZK-Rollup with decentralised and permissionless sequencers and provers. The current design uses SGX proofs and doesn't allow Ethereum block builders to sequence transactions. The zkEVM circuits are based on the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Group research work on zkEVMs, where the team is active contributor.
   
    ###### Focus

    - Implementing circuits for verifying all OPCODEs and Precompiles. The execution of some components of the EVM is currently not verified by the circuits.
    - Allow Ethereum block builders to sequence Taiko blocks
    - Аdding ZK validity proofs and prover marketplace

    | 49 | BLOBHASH | `blobhash(index)` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Returns versioned hash of the `index`-th blob associated with the current transaction.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 4A | BLOBBASEFEE | `block.blobbasefee` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Returns current block’s blob base fee.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 5C | TLOAD | `tload(key)` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Fetches 32-byte word from the transient storage.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 5D | TSTORE | `tstore(key, value)` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Saves the value at the given address in the transient storage.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 5E | MCOPY | `mcopy()` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Copies the memory from source to destination.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 41 | COINBASE | `block.coinbase` | Returns the address of the L2 block proposer | Gets the block’s beneficiary address <Modified />  |
    | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | L2 block number | Gets the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | 48 | BASEFEE | `block.basefee` | Returns the L2 base fee | Returns the base fee <Modified />  |
    
    All other OPCODEs defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however, the execution of some OPCODEs is not verified by the circuits and its not part of the validity proofs.

</Section>

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    > ⚠️ All Precompiled Contacts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however, the execution of those Precompiles is currently not covered by the circuits and therefore not present in the Validity proof

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    <Legend />

    The following system contracts behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1.

    | Address | Name | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | <Copy value="0x000F3df6D732807Ef1319fB7B8bB8522d0Beac02" label="0x000...c02" /> | <Reference label="BeaconRootsStorage" url="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788" /> | Not supported | The contract receives a timestamp and returns the beacon root associated with it <Unsupported /> |
    | <Copy value="0x1670000000000000000000000000000000010001" label="0x167...001" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL2" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L2/TaikoL2.sol" /> | Used to create anchor transaction tracking latest synced L1 block hash and block height. | N/A <Added />

</Section>

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `taiko_headL1Origin` | None | Returns the latest L2 block's corresponding L1 origin | N/A <Added /> |
    | `taiko_l1OriginByID` | L2 block number | Returns the L2 block's corresponding L1 origin | N/A <Added /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Transaction fees are paid in Ether. There is no concept of an L1 calldata fee commonly used in other rollups. Developers must set gasPrice high enough so that the proposer would include their transaction in the proposed block. The base fee adjusts based on the L2 block space demand. 

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
