subtitle: Taiko is a decentralized, Type 1 ZK-Rollup. The protocol does not have a sequencer allowing anyone to become a proposer in a premissionless manner. Prover markets are implemented allowing anyone to be a prover and earn fees for proving L2 blocks.

<Section title="Overview">

    Taiko is a decentralized, Type 1 ZK-Rollup. The protocol does not have a sequencer allowing anyone to become a proposer in a premissionless manner. Prover markets are implemented allowing anyone to be a prover and earn fees for proving L2 blocks.

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    All OPCODEs defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    All Precompiled Contracts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | <Copy value="0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f" label="0x95f..6f" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL1" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L1/TaikoL1.sol" /> | Used for proposing, proving and verifying L2 blocks on L1. |
    | <Copy value="0x1000777700000000000000000000000000000001" label="0x10007777..01" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL2" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L2/TaikoL2.sol" /> | Used to create anchor transaction for block proving on L2. |

</Section>

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    All RPC endpoints defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Arbitrum work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1 fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@arbitrum/sdk](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Arbitrum in regards to L1 ↔ L2 messaging.
