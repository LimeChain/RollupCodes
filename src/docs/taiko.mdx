<Section title="Overview">

    Taiko is a decentralized, Type 1 ZK-Rollup. The protocol does not have a sequencer allowing anyone to become a proposer in a premissionless manner. Prover markets are implemented allowing anyone to be a prover and earn fees for proving L2 blocks.
    
    ###### Focus

    - Full OPCODE EVM equivalence.

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | L2 block number | Gets the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | 48 | BASEFEE | | Returns `1` (wei) | Returns the base fee <Modified />  |

    All other OPCODEs defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however the execution of those OPCODEs by the circuits is not 100% EVM equivalent.

</Section>

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    > ⚠️ All Precompiled Contacts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup, however, the execution of those Precompiles is currently not covered by the circuits and therefore not present in the Validity proof

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | <Copy value="0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f" label="0x95f..6f" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL1" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L1/TaikoL1.sol" /> | Used for proposing, proving and verifying L2 blocks on L1. |
    | <Copy value="0x1000777700000000000000000000000000000001" label="0x10007777..01" /> | <Reference label="TaikoL2" url="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L2/TaikoL2.sol" /> | Used to create anchor transaction for block proving on L2. |

</Section>

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    All RPC endpoints defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Taiko work identically to gas fees on Ethereum.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
