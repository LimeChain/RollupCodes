<Section title="Overview">
Linea is a ZK-Rollup that targets EVM compatibility. As it’s a product of ConsenSys, it is positioned to potentially benefit from better utilisation of the ecosystem's tools and infrastructure.

###### Focus
- Increase the Validity Proof coverage. Currently, the execution of precompiles is not part of the validity proof.
- Progressively decentralize the upgradeability and governance of the Rollup

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `linea_estimateGas` | The transaction call object and integer block number (or the string `latest`, `earliest` or `pending`) | Estimates the gas cost for a transaction including the layer 1 and layer 2 fees <br /> <br /> `linea_estimateGas` uses the same inputs as the standard `eth_estimateGas`, but returns the recommended gas limit, the base fee per gas, and the priority fee per gas | N/A <Added /> |
    | `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1` | `txHash` | Queries a temporary database maintained by the transaction exclusion API service to check if a transaction was rejected by the sequencer, connected P2P node, or RPC nodes for exceeding data line limits that would prevent the prover from generating a proof. <br /> <br /> Note: You can only check for transaction rejection within seven days of the transaction attempt. Querying transactions older than this will return a `null` response <br /> <br /> If the transaction is rejected, the API call will succeed and provide the reason; otherwise, it will return `null` | N/A <Added /> |
    | `linea_getProof` | Address, storage keys and block parameter | Returns the account and storage values, including the Merkle proof, of the specified account. The supplied block parameter must be an L2 block that has been finalized on L1 | N/A <Added /> |
    
</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Transaction fees are paid in Ether. There is no concept of an L1 calldata fee commonly used in other rollups. Developers must set gasPrice high enough so that the sequencer would include the transaction in a batch. Information on the gas price can be retrieved from the JSON RPC endpoint.

    [L2 Gas fees](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/gas-fees).

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [Linea SDK](https://docs.linea.build/api/linea-sdk) focuses on interacting with smart contracts on both Ethereum and Linea networks and provides custom functions to obtain message information.

    [Linea Safe](https://safe.linea.build/welcome) is a white-label fork of Gnosis Safe deployed by the Linea team.
