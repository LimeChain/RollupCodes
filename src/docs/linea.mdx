<Section title="Overview">

    Linea is a developer-ready zkEVM rollup. It leverages quantum-resistant lattice-based cryptography to create zero-knowledge proofs. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network focuses on developing support for non-EVM-based contracts (EVM+), although they are not yet in production.

    ###### Focus

    - 100% EVM equivalence
    - Open source client node
    - Censorship resistant withdrawals
    - Diversified security council
    - Decentralized operators and governance
    - Multi-prover

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    Linea uses the London version of the EVM.

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 5F | PUSH0 |  | Not supported yet! <br /><br /> Solidity version `0.8.20` or higher can only be used with an evm version lower than the default `shanghai`. <br /><br /> Versions up to `0.8.19` (included) are fully compatible | Places value 0 on the stack <Unsupported /> |
    | 44 | DIFFICULTY / PREVRANDAO | `block.difficulty` | Returns a fixed number | Get the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    All Precompiled Contracts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation (until London hard fork) have the same behaviour on the Rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | <Copy value="0xC84832f69bFFbC1A94E44a157A342766E959ED27" label="0xC84...27" /> | <Reference label="PlonkVerifierFull" url="https://github.com/Consensys/linea-contracts/blob/main/contracts/verifiers/PlonkVerifierFull.sol" /> | Plonk verifier contract used by the Linea zkEVM rollup. |

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_newBlockFilter` | None | Not supported  | Creates a filter in the node, to notify when a new block arrives. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_newFilter` | None | Not supported  | Creates a filter object, based on filter options, to notify when the state changes (logs). <Unsupported /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Other than the L1 gas fee component, Linea charges L2 gas fees which should be around 1/15th of Ethereum's, and Linea hopes to reduce them even further in the future.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/) provides smart account tools for ERC-4337
    
    [Bicnomy](https://www.biconomy.io/) SDK provides solutions from onboarding to user engagement for a decentralized application (dApp)
    
    [thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallet/smart-wallet) Smart Wallet SDK, implementing EIP-4337.
    
    [Linea SDK](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/linea-sdk) focuses on interacting with smart contracts on both Ethereum and Linea networks and provides custom functions to obtain message information.
