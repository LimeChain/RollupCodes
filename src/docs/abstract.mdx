<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Abstract's fee model is similar to Ethereum’s where `gas` is charged for computational cost, cost of publishing data on-chain and storage effects. However, Abstract includes additional costs for publishing to L1 and for proof generation. The cost of posting data on L1 is captured by having dynamic gas costs for various OPCODEs such as `SSTORE`. This practically means that when executing `eth_estimateGas` the returned result will vary based on the Ethereum L1 base fee. Detailed information on the [Fee mechanism](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/rollup/fee-model).

<Section title="Tools">

    ###### Compilers

    Contracts on Abstract can be developed using either the **custom ZKsync compilers or standard EVM compilers**, depending on the deployment target:

    - Use the **custom compilers** (`zksolc` / `zkvyper`) for deploying contracts as native EraVM bytecode, which offers better performance and lower fees. This requires plugins for Hardhat or a custom version of Foundry (details below).
    - Use **standard Solidity or Vyper compilers** to deploy unmodified EVM bytecode via the EVM Bytecode Emulator, with broader tooling compatibility (Hardhat and Foundry work without plugins or modifications) but higher execution overhead.

    Available custom compilers:

    - [zksolc Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin) — supports Solidity versions from `0.4.12`, recommended `>=0.8`
    - [zkvyper Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin) — supports Vyper `0.3.3`, `0.3.9`, `0.3.10`, `0.4.0`

    The custom compilers have hardhat plugin integrations for ease of development

    - [hardhat-zksync](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync)
    - [hardhat-zksync-vyper](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync-vyper)

    ###### Other

    - [hardhat-zksync](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync) is a hardhat plugin that bundles all ZKsync related Hardhat plugins
    - [foundry-zksync](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync) provides Foundry functionality in Solidity for compiling, deploying, testing, and interacting with smart contracts on Abstract
