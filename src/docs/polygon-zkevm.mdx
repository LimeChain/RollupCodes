<Section title="Overview">

    Polygon zkEVM is a leading Zero-Knowledge Rollup that targets bytecode-level compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. At the moment, the rollup uses a trusted and centralised sequencer  operated by the core team. Cryptographic proofs are used to ensure the validity of state transitions within the rollup.

    ###### Focus

    - Providing full byte-code level EVM compatibility without requiring any compiler or tooling changes

<Section title="RPC-API">

    | `eth_protocolVersion` | None | Response is always zero. | Returns the current Ethereum protocol version. <Modified /> |
    | `txpool_content` | None | Response is always empty | N/A <Added /> |
    | `zkevm_batchNumber` | None | Returns the latest batch number | N/A <Added /> |

    | `zkevm_virtualBatchNumber` | Hex batch number | Returns the latest virtual batch number. | N/A <Added /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Transaction fees are paid in Ether. There is no concept of an L1 calldata fee commonly used in other rollups. Developers must set `gasPrice` high enough so that the sequencer would include the transaction in a batch. Information on the gas price can be retrieved from the JSON RPC endpoint.

    Additional incentive mechanisms are introduced for sequencers and verifiers. More info in the [docs](https://zkevm.polygon.technology/docs/protocol/incentive-mechanism).

    ###### Other

    Polygon zkEVM introduces `zk-counters` which are computing constraints enforced on OPCODEs / Precompiles similar to `gas`. Each operation increments the counter and if the counter gets above a certain threshold the transaction is reverted.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as `ethers`, `web3.js`, `ethers-rs`, `hardhat`, `foundry` and `truffle`. There might be compatibility issues when the framework uses [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) Type 2 transactions by default, but changing the type to legacy would resolve the problem.
