<Section title="Overview">
   Ink is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing OP Stack technology. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Ink team.

    ###### Focus

    - DeFi applications for both institutions and retail
    - Interoperability with the OP Superchain
    - Integration with the Kraken product suite

<Section title="General">

    <Parameter name="Block time" value="1 second" tooltip="The rate at which the rollup produces blocks. Keep in mind that the value is subject to change in the future" />

    <Parameter name="Gas Limit" value="30 million" tooltip="The gas limit that can be consumed by an L2 block" />

    <Parameter name="Gas Target" value="15 million" tooltip="The EIP-1559 gas target for an L2 block" />

    <Parameter name="Sequencing Frequency" value="10-60 minutes" tooltip="The frequency at which the rollup posts L2 transactions on Ethereum L1. The time varies based on the amount of calldata that must be posted on L1" />

    <Parameter name="Objective Finality"  value="7 days" tooltip="The time it takes for the L2 to reach objective finality. Objective Finality is the state after which actors following only the L1 can conclude that a given state is finalised" />

The <code>DisputeGameFactory</code> contract creates a new <code>FaultDisputeGame</code> contract for every proposed state root change." />

    <Parameter name="State Trie" value="Merkle Patricia Trie + Keccak Hashing" tooltip="The data structure used to represent the state of the Rollup along with the hashing algorithm used to compute the root of the trie" />

    <Parameter name="Transaction Types" tooltip="The types of transactions supported on the Rollup" />

    - **Type 0** - User Transactions. Represent [pre-EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
    - **Type 1** - User Transactions. Represent legacy transactions post [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
    - **Type 2** - User Transactions. Represent [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions
    - **Type 126** - System Transactions. They can be transactions [importing L1 data into Ink](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#l1-attributes-deposited-transaction) or [User-deposited transactions](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#user-deposited-transaction)

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_getTransactionReceipt` | `hash` | Returns information for a given transaction. <br /><br />Adds additional information related to L1 calldata fees. | Returns information for a given transaction. <Modified /> |
    | `optimism_outputAtBlock` | Integer block number or string one of `safe`, `latest` or `pending` | Returns the requested `l2OutputRoot` containing `version` and `l2OutputRoot` | N/A <Added /> |
    | `optimism_syncStatus` | None | Returns information on node’s current, head, safe and finalised L1 state, as well as unsafe, safe and finalized L2 state | N/A <Added /> |

</Section>

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    Ink charges an additional L1 data fee. You can use [@eth-optimism/sdk](https://sdk.optimism.io/modules.html#asL2Provider)
    for wrapping the RPC ethers provider and get access to the L1 and L2 gas
    costs information.

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, viem, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [viem/op-stack](https://viem.sh/op-stack) provides first-class support for chains implemented on the OP Stack.
