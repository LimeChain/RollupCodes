<Section title="Overview">

    Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible Optmistic Rollup. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network focuses on developing support for non-EVM-based contracts (EVM+), although they are not yet in production.

    ###### Focus

    - Fraud proofs technology, already in production
    - Support for WASM-based contracts with a shared state between execution environments - EVM+

    <Parameter name="Transaction Types" tooltip="The types of transactions supported on the Rollup" /> [Reference](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#transactions)

    - **Type 0** - User Transaction. Represent [pre-EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
    - **Type 1** - User Transaction. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions.
    - **Type 100** - System (Bridge) Transaction. A deposit of ETH from L1 to L2 via the Arbitrum bridge.
    - **Type 101** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 user can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
    - **Type 102** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 contract can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
    - **Type 104** - User Transaction. Used to redeem a retriable ticket on L2, which finalizes a retriable that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas)
    - **Type 105** - System (Bridge) Transaction. Retryable tickets are submitted via the L1 bridge and allow arbitrary L1 to L2 messages to be created and executed on L2.
    - **Type 106** - System (Internal) Transaction. Transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like L1 base fee and block number.

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | | Opcode | Name | Solidity equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 5F | `PUSH0` |  | Not supported yet! Solidity version `0.8.20` or higher can only be used with an evm version lower than the default `shanghai`. Versions up to `0.8.19` (included) are fully compatible | Places value 0 on the stack <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 33 | `CALLER` | `msg.sender` | Works the same way it does on Ethereum for normal L2-to-L2 transactions; for L1-to-L2 "retryable ticket" transactions, it will return the L2 address alias of the L1 contract that triggered the message. See [retriable ticket address aliasing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) for more. | Returns caller address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 40 | `BLOCKHASH` | `blockhash(x)` | Returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for `x` within the range `block.number - 256 <= x < block.number`. If x is outside of this range, `blockhash(x)` will return 0. This includes `blockhash(block.number)`, which always returns `0` just like on Ethereum. The hashes returned do not come from L1. | Returns the hash of one of the 256 most recent complete blocks <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 41 | `COINBASE` | `block.coinbase` | Returns `0` | Returns the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 42 | `TIMESTAMP` | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 43 | `NUMBER` | `block.number` | Returns an "estimate" of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction (see [Block Numbers and Time](https://developer.arbitrum.io/time)) | Returns the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 44 | `DIFFICULTY` | `block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` | Returns the constant `2500000000000000` | Returns the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    All Precompiled Contracts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the Rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6d <Copy value="0x6d" /> | `ArbAggregator` | Provides aggregators and their user's methods for configuring how they participate in L1 aggregation. Arbitrum One's default aggregator is the Sequencer, which a user will prefer unless `SetPreferredAggregator` is invoked to change it.<br /><br />[Reference](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbAggregator.go) |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6c <Copy value="0x6c" /> | `ArbGasInfo` | Provides data for gas costs in wei and ArbGas, estimates for L1 basefee as-well as information on the chain speed limit, pool size and transaction gas limit.<br /><br />[Reference](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go) |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6e <Copy value="0x6e" /> | `ArbRetryableTx` | Provides methods for managing retryables (cross domain messages). [Retryable documentation](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging).<br /><br />[Reference](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.go) |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x64 <Copy value="0x64" /> | `ArbSys` | Provides system-level functionality for getting L2 block number, hash, checking if a call is top-level, sending cross-domain messages as-well as sending ETH to L1.<br /><br />[Reference](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbSys.go) |

    | :--- | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `eth_syncing` | None | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. The object when syncing:<br />- `batchSeen` → the last batch number observed on the parent chain<br />- `batchProcessed` → the last batch that was processed on the parent chain. Processing means dividing the batch into messages<br />- `messageOfProcessedBatch` → the last message in the last processed batch<br />- `msgCount` → specifies the number of messages known/queued by the nitro node<br />- `blockNum` → the last block created by the nitro-node (up-to-date L2 block the node is synced to)<br />- `messageOfLastBlock` → the message that was used to produce the block above<br />- `broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos` → If ≠0, this is expected to be > msgCount. This field notes a message that was read from the feed but not processed because earlier messages are still missing<br />- `lastL1BlockNum` → The last block number that nitro sees. This is used to debug the parent-chain connection<br />- `lastl1BlockHash` → The last block hash from the parent chain that nitro sees. This is used to debug the parent-chain connection | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. The object when syncing:<br />- `startingBlock` → the block at which the import started<br />- `currentBlock` → the current block, same as eth_blockNumber<br />- `highestBlock` → Estimated highest block <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `eth_getBlockByHash` & `eth_getBlockByNumber` | - Hash of a block<br />- Integer of a block number, or the string "earliest", "latest" or "pending” | Existing Fields with different Behaviour:<br />- `extraData` → Field is equivalent to sendRoot<br />- `mixHash` → First 8 bytes is equivalent to sendCount, second 8 bytes is equivalent to l1BlockNumber<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at 0x1<br />- `gasLimit` → Value is fixed at 0x4000000000000, but Arbitrum currently has 32M gas limit per block<br /><br />New fields:<br />- `l1BlockNumber` → An approximate L1 block number that occurred before this L2 block<br />- `sendCount` → The number of L2-to-L1 messages since Nitro genesis<br />- `sendRoot` → The Merkle root of the Outbox tree state | - `extraData` → the "extra data" field of this block<br />- `mixHash` → returns the RANDAO random value<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at 0x0 post-merge<br />- `gasLimit` → the gas limit of the block <Modified /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Arbitrum work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1 fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    `@arbitrum/sdk` is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Arbitrum in regards to L1 ↔ L2 messaging.
