<Section title="Overview">

    Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network focuses on developing support for non-EVM-based contracts (EVM+), although they are not yet in production.

    ###### Focus

    - Fraud proofs technology, already in production
    - Support for WASM-based contracts with a shared state between execution environments - EVM+

        - **Type 100** - System (Bridge) Transaction. A deposit of ETH from L1 to L2 via the Arbitrum bridge
        - **Type 101** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 user can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 102** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 contract can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 104** - User Transaction. Used to redeem a retryable ticket on L2, which finalizes a retryable that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas)
        - **Type 105** - System (Bridge) Transaction. Retryable tickets are submitted via the L1 bridge and allow arbitrary L1 to L2 messages to be created and executed on L2
        - **Type 106** - System (Internal) Transaction. Transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like L1 base fee and block number

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 5F | PUSH0 |  | Not supported yet! <br /><br /> Solidity version `0.8.20` or higher can only be used with an evm version lower than the default `shanghai`. <br /><br /> Versions up to `0.8.19` (included) are fully compatible | Places value 0 on the stack <Unsupported /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 33 | CALLER | `msg.sender` | Same behaviour as on Ethereum for L2 to L2 transactions <br /><br /> Returns the L2 address alias of the L1 contract that triggered the message for L1-to-L2 "retryable ticket" transactions. See [retryable ticket address aliasing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) for more. | Returns caller address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 40 | BLOCKHASH | `blockhash(x)` | Returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for `x` within the range `block.number - 256 <= x < block.number`. <br /><br /> If `x` is outside of this range, `blockhash(x)` will return 0. This includes `blockhash(block.number)`, which always returns `0` just like on Ethereum. <br /><br /> The hashes returned do not come from L1. | Returns the hash of one of the 256 most recent complete blocks <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 41 | COINBASE | `block.coinbase` | Returns `0` | Returns the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | Returns an "estimate" of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction (see [Block Numbers and Time](https://developer.arbitrum.io/time)) | Returns the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 44 | DIFFICULTY | `block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` | Returns the constant `2500000000000000` | Returns the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

<Section title="Precompiled Contracts">

    All Precompiled Contracts defined in the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation have the same behaviour on the Rollup.

</Section>

<Section title="System Contracts">

    The Rollup has introduced the following system contracts.

    | | Address | Name | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6d <Copy value="0x6d" /> | [ArbAggregator](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbAggregator.go) | Provides aggregators and their user's methods for configuring how they participate in L1 aggregation. Arbitrum One's default aggregator is the Sequencer, which a user will prefer unless `SetPreferredAggregator` is invoked to change it.|
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6c <Copy value="0x6c" /> | [ArbGasInfo](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go) | Provides data for gas costs in wei and ArbGas, estimates for L1 basefee as-well as information on the chain speed limit, pool size and transaction gas limit.|
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x6e <Copy value="0x6e" /> | [ArbRetryableTx](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.go) | Provides methods for managing retryables (cross domain messages). [Retryable documentation](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging).|
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | 0x64 <Copy value="0x64" /> | [ArbSys](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbSys.go)| Provides system-level functionality for getting L2 block number, hash, checking if a call is top-level, sending cross-domain messages as-well as sending ETH to L1.|

</Section>

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    |      | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :--- | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `eth_syncing` | None | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. The object contains rollup specific information on the sync state of the node such as the last seen or processed batch as-well as L1 state information and messages processed. <br /><br /> Specific list of the differences [here](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#eth_syncing-rpc-method). | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `eth_getBlockByHash` | Hash of a block | The following properties have different behaviour: <br />- `extraData` → Field is equivalent to `sendRoot` <br />- `mixHash` → First 8 bytes is equivalent to `sendCount`, second 8 bytes is equivalent to `l1BlockNumber`<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at `0x1`<br />- `gasLimit` → Value is fixed at `0x4000000000000`, but Arbitrum has 32M gas limit per block <br /><br /> New fields:<br />- `l1BlockNumber` → An approximate L1 block number that occurred before this L2 block<br />- `sendCount` → The number of L2-to-L1 messages since Nitro genesis<br />- `sendRoot` → The Merkle root of the Outbox tree state | - `extraData` → the "extra data" field of this block<br />- `mixHash` → returns the RANDAO random value<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at 0x0 post-merge<br />- `gasLimit` → the gas limit of the block <Modified /> |
    | ![link icon](../images/link-icon.png) | `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Integer of a block number, or the string "earliest", "latest" or "pending” | The following properties have different behaviour: <br />- `extraData` → Field is equivalent to `sendRoot` <br />- `mixHash` → First 8 bytes is equivalent to `sendCount`, second 8 bytes is equivalent to `l1BlockNumber`<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at `0x1`<br />- `gasLimit` → Value is fixed at `0x4000000000000`, but Arbitrum has 32M gas limit per block <br /><br /> New fields:<br />- `l1BlockNumber` → An approximate L1 block number that occurred before this L2 block<br />- `sendCount` → The number of L2-to-L1 messages since Nitro genesis<br />- `sendRoot` → The Merkle root of the Outbox tree state | - `extraData` → the "extra data" field of this block<br />- `mixHash` → returns the RANDAO random value<br />- `difficulty` → fixed at 0x0 post-merge<br />- `gasLimit` → the gas limit of the block <Modified /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Arbitrum work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1 fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@arbitrum/sdk](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Arbitrum in regards to L1 ↔ L2 messaging.
