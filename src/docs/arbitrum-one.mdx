<Section title="Overview">

    Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network also supports WASM-based contracts (MultiVM).

    ###### Focus

    - Fraud proofs technology, already in production
    - Development of WASM-based contracts with a shared state between execution environments

    <Parameter name="Objective Finality" value="7 days" tooltip="The time it takes for the L2 to reach objective finality. Objective Finality is the state after which actors following only the L1 can conclude that a given state is finalised" />

    <Parameter name="State Trie" value="Merkle Patricia Trie + Keccak Hashing" tooltip="The data structure used to represent the state of the Rollup along with the hashing algorithm used to compute the root of the trie" />

    <Parameter name="Node Implementations" value={<Reference label="go-ethereum (Go)" url="https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/tree/master" />} tooltip="The different client implementations of the Rollup" />

    <Parameter name="Transaction Types" tooltip="The types of transactions supported on the Rollup" />

        - **Type 0** - User Transaction. Represent [pre-EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
        - **Type 1** - User Transaction. Represent legacy transactions post [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
        - **Type 2** - User Transaction. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions
        - **Type 100** - System (Bridge) Transaction. A deposit of ETH from L1 to L2 via the Arbitrum bridge
        - **Type 101** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 user can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 102** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 contract can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 104** - User Transaction. Used to redeem a retryable ticket on L2, which finalizes a retryable that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas)
        - **Type 105** - System (Bridge) Transaction. Retryable tickets are submitted via the L1 bridge and allow arbitrary L1 to L2 messages to be created and executed on L2
        - **Type 106** - System (Internal) Transaction. Transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like L1 base fee and block number

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_syncing` | None | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. The object contains rollup specific information on the sync state of the node such as the last seen or processed batch as-well as L1 state information and messages processed. <br /><br /> Specific list of the differences [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#eth_syncing-rpc-method). | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getBlockByHash` | Hash of a block | Returns information for a given block.<br /><br />Adds additional information such as l1 block number, send count and send root. | Returns information for a given block. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Integer of a block number, or the string "earliest", "latest" or "pending” | Returns information for a given block.<br /><br />Adds additional information such as l1 block number, send count and send root. | Returns information for a given block. <Modified /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Arbitrum work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1 fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@arbitrum/sdk](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Arbitrum in regards to L1 ↔ L2 messaging.
