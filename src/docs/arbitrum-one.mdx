<Section title="Overview">

    Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network also supports WASM-based contracts (EVM+).

    ###### Focus

    - Fraud proofs technology, already in production
    - Development of WASM-based contracts with a shared state between execution environments

        - **Type 0** - User Transaction. Represent [pre-EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
        - **Type 1** - User Transaction. Represent legacy transactions post [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transactions
        - **Type 2** - User Transaction. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions
        - **Type 100** - System (Bridge) Transaction. A deposit of ETH from L1 to L2 via the Arbitrum bridge
        - **Type 101** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 user can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 102** - System (Bridge) Transaction. An L1 contract can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge
        - **Type 104** - User Transaction. Used to redeem a retryable ticket on L2, which finalizes a retryable that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas)
        - **Type 105** - System (Bridge) Transaction. Retryable tickets are submitted via the L1 bridge and allow arbitrary L1 to L2 messages to be created and executed on L2
        - **Type 106** - System (Internal) Transaction. Transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like L1 base fee and block number

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    <Legend />

    The following table encapsulates EVM OPCODE differences of the Rollup compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation.

    | Opcode | Name | Solidity Equivalent | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :--- | :-------------------| :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | 4A | BLOBBASEFEE | `block.blobbasefee` | Unsupported. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. | Returns current block’s blob base fee.  <Unsupported /> |
    | 33 | CALLER | `msg.sender` | Same behaviour as on Ethereum for L2 to L2 transactions <br /><br /> Returns the L2 address alias of the L1 contract that triggered the message for L1-to-L2 "retryable ticket" transactions. See [retryable ticket address aliasing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) for more. | Returns caller address <Modified /> |
    | 40 | BLOCKHASH | `blockhash(x)` | Returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for `x` within the range `block.number - 256 <= x < block.number`. <br /><br /> If `x` is outside of this range, `blockhash(x)` will return 0. This includes `blockhash(block.number)`, which always returns `0` just like on Ethereum. <br /><br /> The hashes returned do not come from L1. | Returns the hash of one of the 256 most recent complete blocks <Modified /> |
    | 41 | COINBASE | `block.coinbase` | Returns `0` | Returns the L1 block’s beneficiary address <Modified /> |
    | 42 | TIMESTAMP | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block | Timestamp of the L1 block <Modified /> |
    | 43 | NUMBER | `block.number` | Returns an "estimate" of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction (see [Block Numbers and Time](https://developer.arbitrum.io/time)) | Returns the L1 block number <Modified /> |
    | 44 | DIFFICULTY | `block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` | Returns the constant `2500000000000000` | Returns the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain <Modified /> |

<Section title="RPC-API">

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_syncing` | None | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. The object contains rollup specific information on the sync state of the node such as the last seen or processed batch as-well as L1 state information and messages processed. <br /><br /> Specific list of the differences [here](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#eth_syncing-rpc-method). | Returns object with sync status data or `FALSE`, when not syncing. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getBlockByHash` | Hash of a block | Returns information for a given block.<br /><br />Adds additional information such as l1 block number, send count and send root. | Returns information for a given block. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Integer of a block number, or the string "earliest", "latest" or "pending” | Returns information for a given block.<br /><br />Adds additional information such as l1 block number, send count and send root. | Returns information for a given block. <Modified /> |

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    The L2 fees of Arbitrum work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1 fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)

</Section>

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.

    [@arbitrum/sdk](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) is an npm library providing a set of tools for interacting with Arbitrum in regards to L1 ↔ L2 messaging.
