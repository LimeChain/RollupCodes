<Section title="Overview">

    zkSync Era is a ZK-rollup building  its own zk-friendly and EVM-compatible virtual machine. It leverages a standard JSON RPC API and supports key EVM features such as smart contract composability.  In addition, it introduces novel functionalities such as native account abstraction. All contracts deployed on ZK Sync have to be recompiled with the rollup’s  custom-built compiler.

    ###### Focus

    - Balancing the trade-off between EVM compatibility and the ZK-friendly architecture of the Rollup
    - Introducing Account Abstraction as a first-level citizen of the protocol

<Section title="OPCODEs">

    > ⚠️ Contracts deployed on zkSync Era must be compiled with a custom compiler ([zksolc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin) or [zkvyper](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin)). The Rollup is not bytecode compatible and all smart contracts must be recompiled with the custom compiler prior to deployment on zkSync Era.

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    zkSync Era's fee model is similar to Ethereum’s where `gas` is charged for computational cost, cost of publishing data on-chain and storage effects. However, zkSync Era includes additional costs for publishing to L1 and for proof generation. The cost of posting data on L1 is captured by having dynamic gas costs for various OPCODEs such as `SSTORE`. This practically means that when executing `eth_estimateGas` the returned result will vary based on the Ethereum L1 base fee. Detailed information on the [Fee mechanism](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/concepts/transactions/fee-model.html).

<Section title="Tools">

    ###### Compilers

    Custom compilers must be used when developing Solidity and Vyper contracts on the rollup.

    - [Solidity Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin) - Supported versions are as old as `0.4.12` but it is recommended to use version `0.8`
    - [Vyper Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin) - Only supported version is `0.3.3`

    The compilers have hardhat plugin integrations for ease of development

    - [hardhat-zksync-solc](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/hardhat/hardhat-zksync-solc.html)
    - [hardhat-zksync-vyper](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/hardhat/hardhat-zksync-vyper.html)

    ###### Other

    - [hardhat-zksync-toolbox](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/hardhat/plugins.html#hardhat-zksync-toolbox) is a hardhat plugin that bundles all zkSync related Hardhat plugins
