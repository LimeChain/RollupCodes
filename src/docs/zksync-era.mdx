<Section title="Overview">

    ZKsync Era is a ZK-Rollup building its own zk-friendly and EVM-compatible virtual machine. It leverages a standard JSON RPC API and supports key EVM features such as smart contract composability.  In addition, it introduces novel functionalities such as native account abstraction. Contracts on ZKsync Era can now be deployed using either the rollup’s custom-built compilers (zksolc, zkvyper) or standard Solidity and Vyper compilers, thanks to the introduction of the EVM Bytecode Emulator in protocol version 27 (April 2025).

    ###### Focus

    - Balancing the trade-off between EVM compatibility and the ZK-friendly architecture of the Rollup
    - Introducing Account Abstraction natively as a first-level citizen of the protocol

<Section title="Transaction Fees">

    ZKsync Era's fee model is similar to Ethereum’s where `gas` is charged for computational cost, cost of publishing data on-chain and storage effects. However, ZKsync Era includes additional costs for publishing to L1 and for proof generation. The cost of posting data on L1 is captured by having dynamic gas costs for various OPCODEs such as `SSTORE`. This practically means that when executing `eth_estimateGas` the returned result will vary based on the Ethereum L1 base fee. Detailed information on the [Fee mechanism](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/rollup/fee-model).

<Section title="Tools">

    ###### Compilers

    Contracts on ZKsync Era can be developed using either the **custom ZKsync compilers or standard EVM compilers**, depending on the deployment target:

    - Use the **custom compilers** (`zksolc` / `zkvyper`) for deploying contracts as native EraVM bytecode, which offers better performance and lower fees. This requires plugins for Hardhat or a custom version of Foundry (details below).
    - Use **standard Solidity or Vyper compilers** to deploy unmodified EVM bytecode via the EVM Bytecode Emulator, with broader tooling compatibility (Hardhat and Foundry work without plugins or modifications) but higher execution overhead.

    Available custom compilers:

    - [zksolc Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin) — supports Solidity versions from `0.4.12`, recommended `>=0.8`
    - [zkvyper Compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin) — supports Vyper `0.3.3`, `0.3.9`, `0.3.10`, `0.4.0`

    The custom compilers have hardhat plugin integrations for ease of development

    - [hardhat-zksync](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync)
    - [hardhat-zksync-vyper](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync-vyper)

    ###### Other

    - [hardhat-zksync](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync) is a hardhat plugin that bundles all ZKsync related Hardhat plugins
    - [foundry-zksync](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync) provides Foundry functionality in Solidity for compiling, deploying, testing, and interacting with smart contracts on ZKsync Era
