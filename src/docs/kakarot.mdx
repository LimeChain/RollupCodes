<Section title="Overview">

    > ⚠️ The rollup is still in development. Information presented here may change by the time Mainnet is launched.

    Kakarot is an EVM-compatible high-level ZK-Rollup that leverages Cairo to spearhead innovations on Ethereum. Because Kakarot is built on Cairo, its codebase is extremely slim and thus extremely easy to maintain, adapt to Ethereum changes, or add new features to
   
    ###### Focus

    - Use the Starkware SHARP for proving the state 
    - Finalising development and launching Kakarot Mainnet
    - Add new features such as native account abstraction to the EVM

    <Parameter name="Block Time" value="On demand*" tooltip="The rate at which the rollup produces blocks. Keep in mind that the value is subject to change in the future"/>

    <Parameter name="Gas Limit" value="7 million" tooltip="The gas limit that can be consumed by an L2 block"/>

    <Legend />

    The following endpoints behave differently compared to the canonical Ethereum L1 implementation of the JSON RPC API.

    | Method | Params | Rollup Behaviour | Ethereum L1 Behaviour |
    | :----- | :----- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `eth_getFilterChanges` | Filter ID | Not supported  | Polling method for a filter, which returns an array of events that have occurred since the last poll. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_getFilterLogs` | Filter ID | Not supported  | Returns an array of all logs matching filter with given id. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_newBlockFilter` | None | Not supported  | Creates a filter in the node, to notify when a new block arrives. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_newFilter` | Filter object | Not supported  | Creates a filter object, based on filter options, to notify when the state changes (logs). <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` | None | Not supported  | Creates a filter object in the node, to notify when a new transaction arrives. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_uninstallFilter` | Filter ID | Not supported  | Uninstalls a filter with the given filter id. <Unsupported /> |
    | `eth_feeHistory` | `blockCount`, `newestBlock` and `rewardPercentiles` array | Since Kakarot has no fee market, this will return the base fee over a range of blocks. | Returns the collection of historical gas information. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` | None | Response is always 0 | Get the priority fee needed to be included in a block. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex` | Block hash and integer index | Response is always 0 | Returns information about a uncle of a block by hash and uncle index position. <Modified /> |
    | `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex` | Block number (integer) and integer index | Response is always 0 | Returns information about a uncle of a block by number and uncle index position. <Modified /> |

<Section title="Tools">

    Existing EVM-based tooling is supported such as ethers, web3.js, ethers-rs, hardhat, foundry and truffle.
    
    > ⚠️ When using Hardhat it is recommended to change the configuration of Ignition as shown [here](https://docs.kakarot.org/ecosystem/sdk#hardhat-ignition)
